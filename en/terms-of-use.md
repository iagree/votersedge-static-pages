Content created by third parties and its form, content, accuracy or truthfulness is the sole responsibility of its authors.  VE is not able to fact-check or independently verify the accuracy or completeness of such third-party submissions, we do not undertake to monitor or edit words in any respect, and users are advised to use reasonable diligence before relying on any third-party material appearing on the Site.

The League of Women Voters of California Education Fund, MapLight, and project partners neither support nor oppose candidates or political parties.  

c.	**Sample ballot and polling location data.** The information used to generate sample ballots and polling locations has been provided by either local election authorities, and, for statewide contests, by the Secretary of State's office, or by Google’s Civic Information API.  Data is also mined from the Census database of the U. S. Government.  Neither the League of Women Voters of California Education Fund nor MapLight are responsible for the accuracy of this data. The election official of your county remains the sole authoritative source for information regarding the content of ballot and polling place location. If you believe that either the polling place or ballot data is inaccurate, please report the problem to Voter’s Edge in the state where the problem is observed.

d.	**We are not responsible for linked sites.** The Site contains links to various third-party websites that contain additional information related to elections and the political process. VE does not endorse, approve, certify, or control these external websites. VE does not exercise editorial control or oversight over the content featured by these third-party sites and makes no representation as to their accuracy, objectivity, fairness, completeness, efficacy, timeliness, or correct sequencing of information. Reference therein to any specific commercial product, process, or service by trade name, trademark, service mark, manufacturer, or otherwise does not constitute or imply endorsement, recommendation or favoring by either the League of Women Voters Education Fund or MapLight. VE is not responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any material available on or through such websites.

## 5)	VE CONTENT

_**We Have and Retain All Rights in Our Site and Aggregated Content.**_

Except as expressly provided in these Terms, you agree not to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, sell, license or otherwise exploit the VE Content without our permission.

b.	 **VE’s license to you.** Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, we grant you a license to use the Service, including accessing and viewing VE Content, for your personal, noncommercial use. VE may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason. Except for the rights and licenses expressly granted, VE reserves all other rights and no other rights are granted by implication or otherwise.

## 6)	COPYRIGHT POLICY.

**What if I receive a copyright complaint (DMCA) notification?**

If you receive a notification that your third party content has been removed due to a copyright complaint, it means that the content has been deleted from the Site at the request of the content’s owner.  If VE believes or has reason to believe you may have violated the Intellectual Property Rights of a third party, it may restrict or prohibit you from making future submissions to the Site in its sole discretion.  

If you believe your third party content was removed in error, you have the option to file a counter-notice by following the steps below. When VE receives a valid counter-notice, we will forward a copy to the person who filed the original complaint. If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the submitter of the original complaint is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the content at issue, we will remove the complaint from your record, and we may replace the content that was
removed.

**Note:** There are legal and financial consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith submissions. Before submitting a counter-notice, be sure that you are the actual rights holder of the removed content or that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed in error, and understand the repercussions of submitting a false claim.

(b) Include ALL of the following:

(i) Your name, address, and telephone number;

(ii) DMCA ID printed at the bottom of the notification email;

(v) A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which VE may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original complaint under 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person; and

(vi) A physical or electronic signature (for example, typing your full name).

## 7)	TRADEMARK POLICY

VE respects the trademark rights of others. Accounts with usernames or any other content that misleads others or violates another’s trademark may be updated, transferred or permanently suspended.

**VE Trademarks.** The MapLight, Voter’s Edge (including all versions and variations), and the League of Women Voters of California Education Fund (LWVCEF) names and logos are registered trademarks and are the intellectual property of VE or their respective owners.

## 8)	INDEMNIFICATION.

**You will be responsible for any harm we suffer as a result of your violation of these terms of use.** You agree to indemnify and hold harmless VE and its affiliates and employees from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from any violation by you of these Terms of Use. We reserve the right to take over the exclusive defense of any claim for which we are entitled to indemnification under this Section 8. In such event, you shall provide us with such cooperation as is reasonably requested by us.

## 9)	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

**Your use of the site is subject to certain disclaimers.** OUR SITE IS AVAILABLE “AS IS.” WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT OUR SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. THERE MAY BE DELAYS, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS AND INACCURACIES IN THE NEWS, INFORMATION OR OTHER MATERIALS AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR SITE. WE DO NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO OUR SITE OR ANY INFORMATION OR GOODS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OR ADVERTISED OR SOLD THROUGH OUR SITE. WE DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS, NOR DO WE ENDORSE THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS OR RELIABILITY OF ANY ADVICE, OPINION, STATEMENT OR OTHER MATERIAL OR DATABASE DISPLAYED, UPLOADED OR DISTRIBUTED ON THIS SITE OR AVAILABLE THROUGH LINKS ON OUR SITE. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CORRECT ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS ON OUR SITE. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THAT OUR SITE OR MATERIALS ARE FREE FROM ERRORS DEFECTS, OR FAILURES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION VIRUSES, WORMS, “TROJAN HORSES” OR OTHER DESTRUCTIVE MATERIALS AND WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY SUCH ISSUES. IF YOU RELY ON OUR SITE AND ANY MATERIALS AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR SITE, YOU DO SO SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

OUR SITE MAY CONTAIN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF TEXT, IMAGES, AUDIOVISUAL PRODUCTIONS, OPINIONS, STATEMENTS, FACTS, ARTICLES, DATA OR OTHER INFORMATION CREATED BY US OR BY THIRD PARTIES. DUE TO THE NUMBER OF SOURCES FROM WHICH CONTENT ON OUR SITE IS OBTAINED, AND THE INHERENT HAZARDS OF ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION, THERE MAY BE DELAYS, OMISSIONS OR INACCURACIES IN SUCH CONTENT. ACCORDINGLY, SUCH CONTENT, INCLUDING DATA, IS FOR YOUR REFERENCE ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON BY YOU FOR ANY PURPOSE. IN ADDITION, WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO BACK UP ALL OF THE PERSONAL CONTENT THAT YOU MAINTAIN ON THE SITE.

## 10)	 DISCLAIMER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

IN NO EVENT SHALL VE, ITS SUPPLIERS OR ANY THIRD PARTIES MENTIONED ON VE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE AND STATUTORY DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) RESULTING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE VE AND VE CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT VE IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## 11)	 VE LIABILITY FOR USER CONTENT AND INTERACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WEBSITE.

VE may take any action with respect to third party content that it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion if it believes that such third party content could create liability for VE, damage VE’s brand or public image or cause VE to lose (in whole or in part) the services of its ISPs or other suppliers.

While VE reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove third party content and other material from VE from time to time, VE does not assume any obligation to do so and disclaims any liability for failing to take any such action.

VE is not involved in the actual communications between VE users. As a result, VE has no control over the accuracy, reliability, completeness or timeliness of any content submitted by users on VE and makes no representations about any such content on VE.

In addition, you should note that there are risks – including, but not limited to, the risk of physical harm – when dealing with strangers, foreign nationals and/or underage persons or people acting under false pretenses. You assume all risks associated with dealing with other users with whom users come in contact through VE. By its very nature, other people's information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and, in some cases, will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled.

We expect that you will use caution and common sense when using VE. Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, VE cannot and does not confirm that each user is who they claim to be. As third party websites are used in features on this site, refer to the policies to these third party websites referenced in Section 5(c) of this Terms of Use.

If you are a California resident, you agree to waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.” In other words, understand that VE will be relieved of all liability arising from unknown or unsuspected claims. Because we do not and cannot be involved in user-to-user dealings or control the behavior of participants on VE, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, you release VE (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

VE may contain inaccuracies or typographical errors. VE makes no representations about the accuracy, reliability, completeness or timeliness of any VE content. The use of all VE content is at your own risk. Changes are periodically made to VE and may be made at any time. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the form, content and accuracy of any resume or material contained therein placed by you on VE.

VE cannot guarantee and does not promise any specific results from use of VE. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by a user from VE shall create any warranty not expressly stated herein.

## 12)	 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

VE’S MAXIMUM LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH VE OR YOUR USE OF VE CONTENT, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE), WILL NOT EXCEED $100.

VE and its affiliates and employees are not liable for incidental, indirect, consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages of any kind, including, without limitation, lost revenues or profits, loss of business or loss of data, in any way related to this site or for any claim, loss or injury based on errors, omissions, interruptions or other inaccuracies in our site (including, without limitation, as a result of breach of any warranty or other term of these Terms of Use).

## 13)	 PRIVACY POLICY.

VE takes the privacy of its members very seriously. Our Privacy Policy is available here.  By accepting the Terms of Use, you agree to be bound by our Privacy Policy.

## 14)	MISCELLANEOUS.

These Terms of Use, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by VE without restriction. Any attempt to assign or transfer these Terms of Use and any rights and licenses will be null and void.

**Entire Agreement.** The Terms of Use, including VE’s Privacy Policy, which are hereby incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and VE and governs your use of the site, superseding any contemporaneous or prior agreements between you and VE.

**Governing Laws.** The Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

**Waiver and Severability.** The failure of VE to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties to this Agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

**Notices.** VE may provide you with notices, including, without limitation, those regarding changes to the Terms of Use and other site-related announcements, by postings on the site (for example, by posting to the blog, or on the relevant page(s) of the site affected by such changes) or via email.

**Limitation on claims.** Any action concerning the site must be brought within one year after the reason for the action arises, or the claim is barred.

**VE may be legally compelled to disclose certain information.** You agree that in the event VE receives a subpoena issued by a court or from a law enforcement or government agency, VE may have to comply with such subpoenas without your consent or prior notice to you and may need to disclose your IP address, name, IP location or other information in response thereto.

**Contact Information**. Please send any questions, comments or report any Terms of Use violations to [california@votersedge.org](mailto: california@votersedge.org), [illinois@votersedge.org](mailto: illinois@votersedge.org), or [newyork@votersedge.org](mailto: newyork@votersedge.org).
