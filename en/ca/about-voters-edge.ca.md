### History of Voter's Edge Californa

The League of Women Voters of California Education Fund produced one of the nation’s first election information websites, SmartVoter.org. Since 1996, the Smart Voter project has been California’s premier online source for authoritative, nonpartisan coverage of election contests, candidates, and ballot measures. 

MapLight’s Voter’s Edge tool was first designed to help voters understand the sources of funding behind ballot measures in California. In recent years, the project has expanded to cover candidates and elections in states beyond California.

In 2014, the League and MapLight joined forces to create a successful pilot project. The result is Voter’s Edge California. 

### The Partnership

MapLight and the LWVCEF’s continued collaboration into the 2016 election cycle empowers voters to access the information they need to vote with confidence. Our partnership marries Smart Voter's authoritative coverage of election contests, candidates, and ballot measures with MapLight's deep expertise in public data and technology. The result is Voter’s Edge California, which provides top-to-bottom ballot and campaign finance information in one easy-to-use site, giving voters instant access to political information of unparalleled depth and transparency.
